# TicTacToe

## Introduction
### What is this game ?
This is a simple version of the famous "Tic Tac Toe" game. 
This is a single player game: the player plays with the computer.

This is how the game looks like before the game begins:

![Alt text](TicTacToe1.jpg?raw=true "Tic Tac Toe")

You can choose to start a new game (with the button "Start") or to quit the game (with the button "quit").

If the computer wins then a message box appears:

![Alt text](TicTacToe2.jpg?raw=true "Tic Tac Toe")

And if you win, you will see:

![Alt text](TicTacToe3.jpg?raw=true "Tic Tac Toe")

### Code
This is a game developed using Scala. The graphic interface was created using the swing library.

There are two different classes and the principal object:
- The Square Class,
- The Field Class,
- The principal Object TicTacToeG

### To-do list:
- Count the score
- Better the code (this was my first time using Scala!)
- Make a better design 

Enjoy !
